# This is a test file

Hello!  
This is an example file with several lines.
Some of the lines end with double spaces to indicate new lines.

There are also separate paragraphs.

## *Emphasised Header*

This paragraph contains a mixture of **strong**, *emphasised*,
_emphasised_, __underlined__, ***strong and emphasised***,
~~deleted~~, and `code` text.

Example J code: `(+/@:!&i.-)"0 i. 20` produces %%% (+/@:!&i.-)"0 i. 20 %%%.

```text
This is a multi-line code block.
Markdown calls these fenced code blocks, because they are fenced by either
backticks or tildes at the start and end. I prefer these to the indented code
blocks so I will use these.
```

```
NB. A potential issue with code blocks is use of symbols:

1 * 2 * 3
```

## Lists

- This
- Is
- An
- Unordered
- List

Some more text here.

* This is an unordered list
* But it uses asterisks instead of dashes
* Can we do nested lists?
  - Yes
	- No
	- Maybe So
* Another item

This is a paragraph of text
- It contains a list
- I don't usually use this style so if it's hard I'll nix it
Some more text.

This is the last line of text, but the file has a trailing newline.
