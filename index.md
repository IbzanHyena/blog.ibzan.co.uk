# Ibzan's Blog

Hi!  
I'm Ibzan, a spotted hyena hailing from the UK. My interests include
programming, photography, hillwalking, physics, data, and generally messing
around with computers. Yes, I run Linux.

This site will contain various musings - I don't have any specific plans for
the blog, but I'll probably write about the things I've enjoyed coding recently
as well as any furry-relevant stories that seem fun.

You may notice that the design is relatively minimal. That's because I expect
people will use the reader mode present in most modern browers to read posts,
so there's minimal value in going overboard on the design.

Thanks for stopping by! Want to get in touch? I'd love to hear from you if you
have any thoughts relating to the content here! The most reliable method is
[email][email] or otherwise [Twitter][twitter]. I also have an
[FA][furaffinity] page which I keep mostly up to date with art. I probably won't
read any notes sent there in a timely fashion though.
