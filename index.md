Hi!  
I&rsquo;m Ibzan, a spotted hyena hailing from the UK. My interests include programming, photography, hillwalking, physics, data, and generally messing around with computers.
Yes, I run Linux.

This site will contain various musings&mdash;I don&rsquo;t have any specific plans for the blog, but I&rsquo;ll probably write about the things I&rsquo;ve enjoyed coding recently as well as any furry-relevant stories that seem fun.

The main font used across this website is the excellent [Heliotrope][heliotrope] by Matthew Butterick.
For code and code blocks, I use [Triplicate][triplicate], also by Butterick.

Thanks for stopping by!
If you&rsquo;re looking for code, check my [GitHub][github].
Want to get in touch?
I&rsquo;d love to hear from you if you have any thoughts relating to the content here!
The most reliable method is [email][email].
I also have a [Mastodon account][mastodon], and an [FA][furaffinity] page which I keep mostly up to date with art.
I probably won&rsquo;t read any notes sent there in a timely fashion though.
